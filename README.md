# AsyncTest

 Makes tests within a single module (ExUnit Case) run asynchronously.

  Just `import AsyncTest` and replace `test`s with `async_test`s. It should be a drop-in replacement.

  AsyncTest works in the following way:
  - create a public function instead of a test
  - create a new module with a single test that calls that function
  - mimic `@tags`, `setup`, `setup_all`, and `describe` structure in the new module
  - ensure `setup_all` is called only once - store its result in an
  `Agent` and retrieve it when needed

## Usage

Add `async_test` to deps:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:async_test, github: "software-mansion-labs/elixir_async_test", only: :test}
  ]
end
```

In tests, `import AsyncTest` and replace `test`s with `async_test`s:

```diff
 defmodule MyTest do
   use ExUnit.Case

+  import AsyncTest

-  test "my test" do
+  async_test "my test" do
    assert true
   end
 end
```

Now, all the `async_test`s will run asynchronously regardless of the module.

## Motivation

TL;DR Async tests in a single module may harm performance instead of improving it, thus ExUnit doesn't support them, but in particular cases they're beneficial.

ExUnit always runs tests in a single module synchronously (except of [parameterized tests](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/ExUnit.Case.html#module-parameterized-tests)). [This PR](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/13283) was an attempt to change it, but, as described there, it didn't bring improvement to examined projects.

Sometimes, though, async tests in a single module help a lot. One example is [Boombox](https://github.com/membraneframework/boombox), where there's a lot of IO-bound, independent tests, and no reason to move them to different modules. Another one is [Popcorn](https://github.com/software-mansion/popcorn), where tests are CPU-bound, but also independent and very unevenly distributed across modules.
