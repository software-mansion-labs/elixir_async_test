# AsyncTest

 Makes tests within a single module run asynchronously.

  Just `import #{inspect(__MODULE__)}` and replace
  `test` with `async_test`. It should be a drop-in
  replacement.

  #{inspect(__MODULE__)} works in the following way:
  - create a public function instead of a test
  - create a new module with a single test that calls that function
  - copy all `@tags` to the newly created module
  - handle `setup` and `setup_all` similarly to `test`s - the `setup`
  in the new module calls a public function from the original module
  - ensure `setup_all` is called only once - store its result in an
  `Agent` and retrieve it when needed

## Usage

Add `async_test` to deps:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:async_test, github: "software-mansion-labs/elixir_async_test"}
  ]
end
```

In tests, `import AsyncTest` and replace `test` with `async_test`:

```diff
 defmodule MyTest do
   use ExUnit.Case

+  import AsyncTest

-  test "my test" do
+  async_test "my test" do
    assert true
   end
```

Now, all the `async_test`s will run asynchronously regardless of the module.
